</Steps>

## How to register an alias
If you have a card with an alias that **isnâ€™t listed** for that character, please run `kci cardcode` in a server with the Keqing bot. Keqing will automatically register it as an alias for that character.

## How it works
Keqing scours known Kci messages to find all and any instances of a character aliases.
