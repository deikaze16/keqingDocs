## Important notes
* The calculator will not account for good/bad effort. Please adjust your price accordingly (i.e., for bad effort, choose the lower price on the range/below the range. for good effort, choose the higher price on the range/above the range).
* The calculator will not account for special/carousel/event frames. Please look up the frame in question to see what it is going for on the market currently, then add that to the price.
* The calculator will not account for morphs. If you believe your morph is pure or of value, please get it appraised by a professional morph appraiser, then add the result to the price.

## FAQ
> ‚ÄúIs the price calculator accurate?‚Äù

#### Answer:
The calculator is very accurate for most cards. The rates used within the calculator are based off the current pricing guide (updated around twice a month). The guide is created by carefully averaging over 100 sold deals in karuta, meaning the calculator‚Äôs prices are as accurate as possible.
