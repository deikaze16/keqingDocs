### Important Note
If your card's condition is `mint` the calculation should be **mostly accurate**, However if your cards is not mint yet, the calculations are **less accurate**.

### Other calculation info
- **Vanity** = What is vanity? The lower card's print number relative to amount printed, the more this effort modifier will increase. Thus, card will gain in this modifier `as time passes`.
- **Max Vanity** = a condition where your card is S grade or reaches Maxed A grade Vanity. High printed cards **most likely will never** reaches this condition.
- **X Toughness** = You can gain it from `dating system`.
- **Max Possible Effort** = (Current Effort (Mystic + Framed)) + (S Vanity / Maxed A Vanity) + (S Toughness) + Additional Wellness. If your card is high printed, **Do not** look at the `Max A. vanity + S. tough.` stats.
